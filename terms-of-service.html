        <h2>Eligibility and Accounts</h2>
        
        <h3>Eligibility</h3>
        <p>
            You must be at least the minimum legal age in your jurisdiction to form a binding 
            contract to use the Service. If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization 
            you represent, you confirm you are authorized to accept these Terms on its behalf.
        </p>

        <h3>Account Registration</h3>
        <p>
            Some features may require an account in future versions. If accounts are introduced, 
            you will need to provide accurate information and keep credentials secure. You are 
            responsible for all activity under your account. Notify us immediately of any 
            unauthorized use.
        </p>

        <h2>Access and Use</h2>

        <h3>License</h3>
        <p>
            We grant you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use 
            the Service in accordance with these Terms.
        </p>

        <h3>Acceptable Use</h3>
        <p>
            Do not use the Service for unlawful purposes, to harass others, cheat, reverse 
            engineer, or otherwise interfere with its operation or other users' experience. 
            Automated scraping, cheating tools, and unauthorized bots are prohibited.
        </p>

        <h3>Modifications</h3>
        <p>
            We may change, suspend, or discontinue features of the Service at any time without 
            liability.
        </p>

        <h2>Purchases, Subscriptions and Virtual Goods</h2>

        <h3>In-App Purchases</h3>
        <p>
            Certain content or functionality may be offered for purchase. All purchases are 
            final except as required by law. Fees are processed by the store platform 
            (App Store, Google Play) or our payment provider.
        </p>

        <h3>Virtual Goods</h3>
        <p>
            Virtual items purchased or earned in the game are intangible and have no monetary 
            value outside the Service. We may modify, remove, or expire virtual goods at our 
            discretion with reasonable notice.
        </p>

        <h2>Content and Intellectual Property</h2>

        <h3>Your Content</h3>
        <p>
            You retain ownership of content you submit (such as usernames or uploaded images 
            in future versions), but by submitting you grant us a nonexclusive, worldwide, 
            royalty-free license to use, display, and distribute that content to operate and 
            promote the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>Our Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>
            All intellectual property in the Service including trademarks, graphics, code, and 
            game assets are owned by us or licensed to us. You must not copy, distribute, or 
            create derivative works without our written permission.
        </p>

        <h2>Safety, Privacy and Data Use</h2>

        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>
            Use of the Service is also governed by our Privacy Policy (available at 
            <a href="https://rainbow-rollers.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank">rainbow-rollers.com/privacy-policy</a>), 
            which explains how we collect, use, and share information.
        </p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
            You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your account credentials if 
            accounts are introduced. We will never ask for your password via unsolicited email. 
            Report suspicious activity promptly.
        </p>

        <h2>Third Party Services and Links</h2>
        <p>
            The Service may link to third party services (such as payment processors or app stores). 
            We are not responsible for third party content or practices. Third party services may 
            require separate terms and privacy settings.
        </p>

        <h2>Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>

        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>
            The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind. 
            We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation.
        </p>

        <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, our liability for any claim arising from 
            your use of the Service will not exceed the amount you paid us in the past 12 months 
            or one hundred US dollars ($100) if you paid nothing.
        </p>

        <h3>Indemnification</h3>
        <p>
            You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims, losses, damages, liabilities, 
            and expenses arising from your breach of these Terms, your violation of law, or your 
            use of the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>Termination and Suspension</h2>
        <p>
            We may suspend or terminate your access for violations of these Terms or for security 
            reasons. Termination does not relieve you of obligations incurred before termination.
        </p>

        <h2>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, United States. 
            Disputes will be resolved in the state or federal courts located in Orange County, 
            California, unless otherwise required by local law. If your local law requires 
            different rules, those rules apply where mandated.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
            We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated Terms at 
            <a href="https://rainbow-rollers.com/terms-of-service" target="_blank">rainbow-rollers.com/terms-of-service</a>
